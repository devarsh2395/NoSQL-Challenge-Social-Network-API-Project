# NoSQL-Challenge-Social-Network-API-Project

![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description

This is a project for an API that lets people share their thoughts and react to their friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It's made using Express.js for routing, MongoDB for the database, and Mongoose ODM. The project shows how important it is to build and structure the API before building the full app. MongoDB is a popular choice for social networks because it can handle large amounts of data that isn't structured.

## User Story

AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
